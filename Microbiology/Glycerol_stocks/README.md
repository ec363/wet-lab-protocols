# Glycerol stocks

day 1:

* make overnight cultures (in LB, with antibiotics, 10ml in 50ml falcon)

day 2:

* label cryotubes using label maker, including:
	* your initials, YYYY.MM.DD
	* DNA construct(s) (full plasmid name if possible)
	* cell strain
	* antibiotic resistance(s), origin of replication(s)
* good practice: make 2x stocks, labelled with red and green spots on top of the tube: the green tube is used routinely, the red tube is only removed from the freezer if the green stock is suspected of being too old (too many freeze thaws, poor growth etc.)
* aliquot 500 ul 40% glycerol into each tube
* add 500ul of appropriate overnight culture

important:

* keep a record of **which plasmids** you have made glycerol stocks for **and in which strain**, and (if relevant) in which -80 freezer box
